Period of stay is the number of days the visa holder is allowed to\n                                stay in Sri Lanka. For instance, the validity of a Sri Lanka visa is 6 months and stay period is 30\n                                days. The visa holder can enter Sri Lanka anytime within the 6 months period from the date of issue but\n                                will be permitted to stay for up to 30 days only. The Sri Lanka visa validity and stay period are completely at the discretion of the High Commission of\n                                Sri Lanka and are displayed on the e visa Srilanka copy."

        "question": "What is OK to Board (OTB)?",
        "answer": "Ok to Board is a verification procedure undertaken by the airline to check the\n                                authenticity of your Dubai visa. OTB is a message entered in the airline’s reservation\n                                system against your PNR number. It means that your paper-based visa (one that is not\n                                stamped in the passport) has been inspected and validated, and that airline check-in\n                                staff can issue you a boarding pass and allow you to board the flight."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is OK to Board required?",
        "answer": "Typically, if an airline lets a passenger without a valid Dubai visa and OTB to board a flight,\n                                they will be fined by the authorities in UAE, and will also be made to bear the cost of\n                                repatriating the offender. To combat this, airline check-in staff ensures that the\n                                passenger has a valid passport and Dubai visa prior to issuing a boarding pass."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Ok to Board mandatory?",
        "answer": "Due to an increase in fake visas to the UAE, many Indian passengers were deported back to\n                                India in the past. To minimize the fake visa issues, airlines flying to the UAE re-check the\n                                applicant’s Dubai visa and the return airline ticket before the departure to the UAE."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if the OTB status is not updated?",
        "answer": "The Airline will not allow you to board the flight. You may also not get any refund for\n                                your flight ticket."

        "question": "The Schengen Visa is valid for which countries??",
        "answer": "A Schengen Visa (issued by a consulate or embassy of a Schengen State) is valid for all 26 States\n                                of the Schengen Area (including the European territory of Spain), unless it is marked otherwise\n                                on the visa sticker. So you do not need another visa to enter or stay in the European territory\n                                of Spain. However, you must be in possession of documentary evidence for the reasons of your\n                                stay and your means of support.

This means\n                                that the total duration of stay is of maximum 90 days in any period of 180 days. The precise\n                                length of validity of your Schengen Visa is indicated on the visa sticker under the heading\n                                “Duration of visit”.

In order to control the fake visa issuance and any fraudulent\n                                activities; airlines and sponsors double check the UAE Visa and Air tickets before\n                                departure and only after checking the visa authenticity, airlines update visa\n                                message in the respective PNR."

        "question": "Do I have to present any other document at the Schengen external borders apart from my travel document with the Schengen Visa?",
        "answer": "The short-stay visa does not automatically entitle you to enter the Schengen area. At the border (or during other controls) you may have to show the visa but also provide additional documentation, for example; sufficient evidence that you have sufficient means to cover the stay and the return trip. It is therefore recommended that you carry with you copies of the documents which you presented when applying for the Schengen visa (e.g. letters of invitation, travel confirmations, other documents stating the purpose of your stay)."

A Visa on Arrival is something Indians do not need to apply for abroad but simply purchase in the arrival and immigration hall after you have landed in Indonesia. With this visa, you can stay for more than 30 days but only up to 60 days from the date of arrival. This visa is valid for 30 days and can be extended once for another 30 days. The visa fee on arrival is US$35. However, we recommend you to take advantage of the Visa exemption if your stay is less than 30 days. Why would you have to get a Visa on Arrival and pay 35USD for a Visa free facility that also allows you only to stay 30 days?"

So you do not need another visa to enter or stay in the European territory\n                                of Austria.

This means\n                                that the total duration of stay is of maximum 90 days in any period of 180 days. The precise\n                                length of validity of your Schengen Visa is indicated on the visa sticker under the heading\n                                “Duration of visit”.
